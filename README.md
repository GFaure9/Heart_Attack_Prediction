# ML for Heart Attack Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focusing on exploration/analysis and prediction on the
following [Kaggle.com]() dataset: [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset/data).


Different methods for data visualization, variables selection, dataset pre-processing and
ML prediction model selection are presented. Tested models are:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
